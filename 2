Use udisksctl from package=udisks2 (in both Ubuntu and Debian). Procedure is:

Find the ID of the block device you want to mount, using lsblk:

user@machine:~$ lsblk
NAME   MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
sda      8:0    0   1.8T  0 disk
├─sda1   8:1    0  19.1M  0 part /boot/efi
├─sda2   8:2    0   1.8T  0 part
└─sda3   8:3    0    16G  0 part [SWAP]
sdb      8:16   0 931.5G  0 disk
├─sdb1   8:17   0    37M  0 part
├─sdb2   8:18   0  15.9G  0 part [SWAP]
└─sdb3   8:19   0 915.7G  0 part /
sdc      8:32   1  14.4G  0 disk
└─sdc1   8:33   1  14.4G  0 part
sdd      8:48   0   1.8T  0 disk
└─sdd1   8:49   0   1.8T  0 part
From its size, /dev/sdc1 seems to be the USB drive I want to mount.

Use udisksctl to mount the device. Note that -b == --block-device (to reduce typing) but I prefer long options for documentation:

user@machine:~$ udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdc1
==== AUTHENTICATING FOR org.freedesktop.udisks2.filesystem-mount ===
Authentication is required to mount Kingston DT microDuo 3C (/dev/sdc1)
Multiple identities can be used for authentication:
 1.  XXXXX,,, (user)
 2.  ,,, (YYYYY)
Choose identity to authenticate as (1-2): 1
Password:
==== AUTHENTICATION COMPLETE ===
Mounted /dev/sdc1 at /media/user/USBDRIVELABEL.
Addressing Hans Deragon's comment below: you can also tell udisksctl to do --no-user-interaction. It does not attempt to authenticate the user, which usually "just works":

user@machine:~$ udisksctl mount --block-device /dev/sdc1 --no-user-interaction
# possibly some complaining here about I/O charset or need to run `fsck`
Mounted /dev/sdc1 at /media/user/USBDRIVELABEL.
